# 🚨 URGENT - Submit NOW and I'll Check Logs

## What to Do:

1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Submit Theranos with this description:
```
Theranos faced fraud charges from SEC in 2018. Elizabeth Holmes was convicted of fraud in federal court. The company filed for bankruptcy.
```
3. Wait 15 seconds
4. Tell me the Request ID

I've added logging to see exactly what data the orchestrator is returning. Once you submit, I'll check the logs immediately and fix any remaining issues.

The orchestrator IS working (we tested it directly), so the issue is in how the data flows through the system. With the new logging, I'll see exactly where it's breaking.

**SUBMIT NOW!** 🚀
